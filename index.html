							*All cells come from cells* - If you step back for a second and consider this statement, it is remarkable how much weight this statement has:

							As adults, our body consists of several trillion cells, yet we start out from a single fertilised egg.

							Over the last three years, I've been working in Bela Novak's group on a set of projects in this context aimed at shedding more light on a problem, which could be stated in colloquial terms as follows:

							How do cells make sure that they put on their socks before they put on their shoes?

							Let me elaborate a bit more:

							The cell cycle is the process whereby, cells grow, replicate their genetic material and divide.

							For metazoans, we divide it into four stages: the gap phases G1 and G2 - when the cell primarily grow; S-phase - when the DNA is replicated and mitosis - when the nucleus is divided.

							In my work I focus on the regulation of mitosis, where it is absolutely crucial that things happen in order:

							1. In cells undergoing open mitosis first the DNA becomes condensed. At this stage, sister chromatids, that is to say corresponding copies of chromosomes are held together by the ring-shaped cohesin complex. An apparatus of microtubules motor proteins begins to organise around centrosomes. Finally, the nuclear envelope is disassembled, and **Prophase** has ended.

							2. Next - in **Prometaphase** the mircotubules begin to invade the centre of the cell capture pairs of sister chromatids by binding to large protein complexes that assemble in the centromeric region of each chromatid.

							3. Once corresponding sisters have become attachced to opposite poles of the spindle, the chromatids are said to have become bi-oriented; the hallmark of **Metaphase**.

							4. In **Anaphase**, the cohesin is cleaved and sister chromatids are separated towards opposite poles of the spindle, by pole-ward pulling forces within the spindle, as well as pushing forces from bundles of microtubules that nucleate between the separating sisters.

							5. This so-called central spindle also serves the purpose of determining the position of the equator of the cell in **Telophase**, when the cell membrane begins to gradually invade the equatorial plane, while the cell elongates.
							Moreover, **Telophase** can be understood as prophase in reverse: The nuclear envelope is reassembled on the chromatin, which in turn becomes decondensed.

							How can temporal order and control arise in self-organised molecular systems?
						</h2>
						<aside data-markdown class="notes">
							Do you spot the issue with this all too smooth description of this process?
							Cells encode the identity of chromatids topologically, by tying corresponding sisters together, and breaks these ties only if the mitotic spindle can pull them apart correctly.

							If sister chromatid cohesion were lost prematurely - before biorientation - the information of "belonging-ness" of chromatids would be lost, with potentially grave consequences for the cell.

							This is only one prominent example! Likewise reassembling the nuclear envelope before separation of the sister chromatids would be problematic.

							SO: How can temporal order and control arise in self-organised molecular systems?

						<h1>The Mitotic Checkpoint</h1>
						<aside data-markdown class="notes">
							Cells have evolved an intricate feedback control system, which I shall call the Mitotic Checkpoint. It delays progression into anaphase until all pairs of sisters have become bioriented.

							This checkpoint consists of two sub-modules: a surveillance and error correction system, and a checkpoint enforcement mechanism.

							The error corretion module monitors the attachment state of each chromatid pair and destabilises incorrect attachments. The checkpoint enforcement mechanism produces a soluble inhibitor that prevents premature initiation of anaphase.

							The field on this topic is quite big, and thanks to momentuous effort, we know a lot about the molecular basis of the mitotic checkpoint...

						<aside data-markdown class="notes">
							To destabilise incorrect attachment configuration, such as
							- monotelic
							- syntelic
							- merotelic
							Error Correction must integrate the attachment state of the kinetochore on each of the two sisters. This is achieved through a tension-sensitive mechanism:

							Aurora B kinase, which is part of the chromosomal passenger complex, phosphorylates the binding interface between kinetochores and microtubules.
							It thus abolishes the electrostatic interaction between kinetochore and microtubule and destabilises the attachment.

							Only correct, amphitelic attachment configuration will experience equal drag from the two poles of the mitotic spindle. This results in a sufficiently strong deformation of the kinetochore, that the phosphorylation targets are displaced out of reach of the sharp aurora b activity gradient.

							This provides a mechanism that biases the attachment process towards the formation of correct attachment.

							Anaphase is initiated by the activation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) by its co-activator Cdc20. This confers it with susbtrate specificity towards it's early anaphase substrates cyclin B and securin and allows it to target them for proteasomal degradation.
							Securin acts as chaperone and stoichiometric inhibitor of separase, which promotes the segragation of sister chromatids as specific protease to cohesin.
							Cyclin B is the crucial activator of the mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase, CDK1, whose activity high in mitosis and crucial in maintaining the mitotic state.

						<aside data-markdown class="notes">
							To delay the singular event of APC/C:Cdc20 activation that drives the cell into anaphase in a manner that gives the error correction time to promote amphitelic attachments, cells produce a soluble inhibitor called mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC).

							If unattached kinetochores are present, the checkpoint is active.
							They serve as catalytic platforms in the assembly of MCC, which - once assembled - binds very tightly to APC/C, and acts as a stoichiometric inhibitor.

							In prometaphase the rate of production of MCC by unattached kinetochores is sufficiently high that a single unattached kinetochore is sufficient to delay the onset of anaphase.

							Once all chromosomes have become attached, the checkpoint is satisfied, the  assembly of MCC from its components ceases, and a set of processes directing the disassembly of MCC remove the APC/C-inhibitor in metaphase, and lead to timely activation of APC/C.
							Noteably, the checkpoint retains the capacity to become re-engaged when it is satisfied. Only after the onset of anaphase does it become irreversibly inactivated.
